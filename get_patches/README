A simple script to look through components, find the commits that are
locally carried, generate patchfiles for them, and stick them somewhere.
Handy when someone wants to inspect stuff that isn't in the requisite
upstream branch (as would often be the case if, say, we cherry-picked
a patch that hasn't finished the review process yet because it fixes
something that's broken in our infrastructure).
